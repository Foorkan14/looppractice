//for loop syntax
//first section is initialization/creation of the variable
//second section is the condition that the loop will run in
//third section is how the  variable will change after each loop



//make a loop that will console log numbers 1-20 and squaring those numbers  //remember to run javascript files you put node and then name of the file
for(let i=0; i<=20; i++){
    console.log(i*i);
}
